- 👋 Hi, I’m Emil Olausson. 
I am a Swedish information and communications engineer currently working in medical engineering.
I completed my engineering degree in 2025 at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, with a
bachelor's focus on information and communications and a master's focus on medical engineering.
Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in medical science at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.
I’m interested in a lot of different ways that computers work and how to develop software solutions for different problems.
