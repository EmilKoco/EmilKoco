- 👋 Hi, I’m Emil Olausson. 
I am an Swedish information and communications engineer, that is currently working with medical engineering.
I finished my engineering degree in 2025 at the Royal Institute of techonolgy in Stockholm, with a bachelor
focus on information and communications and a master's focus on medical engineering.
Currently I am pursuing a PhD in medical science at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.
I’m interested in a lot of different ways that computers work and how to develop
software solutions for different problems.
